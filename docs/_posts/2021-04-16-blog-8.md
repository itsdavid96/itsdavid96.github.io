# Infrastructure as Code
What is actually meant when talking about infrastructure as code? There are many components used to automating your infrastructure but the most critical one is your infrastructure code. If you start to think of infrastructure as code you will see that it is a process of applying techniques, practices, and tools from software development to create reusable, maintainable, extensible, and testable infrastructure. 

You should try to build and operate your infrastructure like software. But first lets look at some differences. Software has source code and infrastructure has an equivalent in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). Software's have interpreters as infrastructure has an equivalent in AWS service APIs. Software has a desired application state as Infrastructure has a desired infrastructure state. 

## Benefits
There are many benefits of treating infrastructure as code. Repeatability is one of major advantages when treating your infrastructure as code. An example would be taking an AWS CloudFormation template and roll out the development environment. You will be able to test automatic scaling and application, when successful you can use the same resources later on in production.  Repeat and reusability will be the biggest advantaghes as you repeatedly create environments they can become templates to build the same environments over and over again gaining practice.

In this scenario the template was updated to add new security groups to the instance stack.  You will only need one change in the template in order to make a new security group to all four environments. This makes maintaining resources easier, parallel, and more consistent. 

## AWS CloudFormation
Infrastructure can be treated as code within AWS CloudFormation.
