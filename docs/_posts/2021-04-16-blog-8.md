*Introduction to Why Infrastructure as Code is important and AWS Cloud Formation introduction.*
# Infrastructure as Code
What is actually meant when talking about infrastructure as code? There are many components used to automating your infrastructure but the most critical one is your infrastructure code. If you start to think of infrastructure as code you will see that it is a process of applying techniques, practices, and tools from software development to create reusable, maintainable, extensible, and testable infrastructure. 

You should try to build and operate your infrastructure like software. But first lets look at some differences. Software has source code and infrastructure has an equivalent in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). Software's have interpreters as infrastructure has an equivalent in AWS service APIs. Software has a desired application state as Infrastructure has a desired infrastructure state. 

## Benefits
There are many benefits of treating infrastructure as code. Repeatability is one of major advantages when treating your infrastructure as code. An example would be taking an AWS CloudFormation template and roll out the development environment. You will be able to test automatic scaling and application, when successful you can use the same resources later on in production.  Repeat and reusability will be the biggest advantaghes as you repeatedly create environments they can become templates to build the same environments over and over again gaining practice.

In this scenario the template was updated to add new security groups to the instance stack.  You will only need one change in the template in order to make a new security group to all four environments. This makes maintaining resources easier, parallel, and more consistent. 

## AWS CloudFormation
Infrastructure can be treated as code within AWS CloudFormation. AWS CloudFormation will allow you to create the template we mentioned earlier to launch, configure, and connect AWS resources with JSON or YAML formatted templates. 

AWS CloudFormation templates allow you to treat it as and manage it by using your choice of version control like Git. It also allows you to define an entire application stack which is all the resources required for your application in a JSON file. It will also allow you to definre runtime parameters for a template such as Amazon EC2 or Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. 

In AWS CloudFormation you will be able to create YAML-formatted templates in order to describe your AWS resources and properties. You will need to model and describe reosurce and properties in your AWS infrastructure using YAML or JSON formatted templates. Both templates have the same structure and support all the same features. 

Cross stack referencing can be created to let you share outputs from once stack with another. Cross-stack references let you use a layered or service-oriented architecture. Instead of including all resources in a single stack, you create related AWS resources in separate stack and then refer to the required resource outputs from other stacks. For example it can be usefule for customers who seperate their AWS infrastructure into logical components grouped by a stack and need a way to loosely couple stacks together. 
## Making CloudFormation templates
AWS CloudFormation templates can be created using Simple JSON syntax, with an editor like Atom or Sublime Text or a YAML text editor. Another way to build these templates is by using your own CloudFormation designer tool and designing it in the console.

## Organizing CloudFormation Templates
Even though templates can be reused to create multiple environments, it is not recommended to use one template for building a whole application. You should practice grouping your resources into templated based on their ownership and their place in the application lifecycle. At minimum you should have a seperate template for network resources, security resources, and application resources. You will want to lock your security resources and seperating from the rest of your templates. Also keep in mind when setting up a test or production environment you should not share the same templates as resources in a test environment can change very frequently. 
You want to avoid sharing a single template accoss applications for resources of the same type unless you are deliberately centralizing control of that resource type.
