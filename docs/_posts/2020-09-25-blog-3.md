This was a pretty slow week for me. One main assignment I had was for my web engineering class. This week's lab was introducing us to CSS. CSS stands for Cascading style sheets. It is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. The lab was regarding controlling styling throughout a website using a styles sheet for the whole website. The first step was to use to the reference style sheet provided to me and apply it to all the pages. This was placed on the header of each page. Next I needed to set the page background color for each page. For this assignment we went with the color Becca purple. Next we had random floating images on our pages so we need to format those accoridng to the pages. We find the flowright or flowleft properties and pick the best formatting for our page. This made the text of the page wrap around the image as opposed to just being pushed to the side. The final thing the lab asked us to do was to set the site-wide topography. I was requested to write a rule that set the pages default font size to 100%, verdana as the font family, geneva and the default sans-serif families as fallbacks. After this my website was done and all the pages had CSS styling corporated into them. Next week I plan to work on Lab 2 for my Senior design class and to finish my first project for my web engineering class.
