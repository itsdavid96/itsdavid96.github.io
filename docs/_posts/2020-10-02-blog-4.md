This week in my web engineering class we learned more about HTML elements. We got introduced to block elements. They tend to span the entire width of its container, and are by default the same height as the content contained between the tags. It is also possible to nest block elements within other block elements as well as inline elements. Inline elements tend to be the height and width of their content. They are usually aligned to the left, side by side in a line. Unlike block elements they can only be nested within other inline elements. 

In order to describe how size elements are calculated, we use the CSS box model. Every HTML element is a rectangular box to the browser you are using. In order to determine the size and spacing in these elements we use five different CSS properties. They are width, height, padding, margin, border. The width and height are used to set a width and height to the content box. The padding adjusts the space inside of the element. Margin then controls the amount of space around the perimeter of the element and the border adds a border between the padding and the margin. We use all of these in order to create a content wrapper. This makes it so the background will stay wrappped to the page no matter where you go.
