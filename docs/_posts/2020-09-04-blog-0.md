This week I got introduced to HTML. From my prior knowledge HTML was that it is the language used to structure content on the web. Suprisingly I have never had hands on experience with HTML. I think the only time I have ever really tried to do anything with HTML was when I was a teenager trying to edit my MySpace page with my friends. Apart from that this week I had my first real HTML assignment for my Web Engineering class. At first it was very overwhelming seeing all the code and only understanding minimal things from prior coding knowledge. 

The first thing I knew I had to learn was the syntax of HTML as that would make reading and learning the language relatively simple. In HTML there are a lot of tags which help identifying what the content within those tags are. An example of an opening and closing paragraph tag would be `<p> </p>`.
