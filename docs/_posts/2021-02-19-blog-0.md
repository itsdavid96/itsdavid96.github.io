## Building a VPC
Today we will be building a VPC with 2 public and 2 private subnets. We need here a server for public and a server for private to serve traffic into our private instance.
This tutorial will be done using ***Amazon Web Services***.
# Elastic IP
First thing you will need before creating a VPC is an elastic IP

1. Go to elastic IP's, under network and security on your Dashboard.
2. Click on Allocate Elastic IP Address.
3. You will want to set the Network Border Group to your location. In this case we will be using us-west 2. Click allocate.

  You now have a public IPv4 Address.
  
## VPC Wizard

 1. Go to VPC. (As you can see every region has a default vpc.) 
 2. You will launch the VPC Wizard.
 3. Select the option for **VPC with Public and Private Subnet** and click select.

This option will create a NAT Gateway for you. Which will do the network address translation.

4. You can use the default iPv4 CIDR block.
 5. Name your VPC.
 6. You can leave the defaults for the public and private subnets for this exercise. 
 7. Make sure your availability zones are set to your location. 
 8. Enter the Elastic IP Allocation ID you created and create the VPC.
