# Building a VPC
Today we will be building a VPC with 2 public and 2 private subnets. We need here a server for public and a server for private to serve traffic into our private instance.
This tutorial will be done using ***Amazon Web Services***.
## Elastic IP
First thing you will need before creating a VPC is an elastic IP

1. Go to elastic IP's, under network and security on your Dashboard.
2. Click on Allocate Elastic IP Address.
3. You will want to set the Network Border Group to your location. In this case we will be using us-west 2. Click allocate.

  You now have a public IPv4 Address.
  ## VPC Wizard
1. Go to VPC. (As you can see every region has a default vpc.) 
2. You will launch the VPC Wizard.
