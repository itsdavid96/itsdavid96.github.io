## Building a VPC
Today we will be building a VPC with 2 public and 2 private subnets. We need here a server for public and a server for private to serve traffic into our private instance.
This tutorial will be done using ***Amazon Web Services***.
# Elastic IP
First thing you will need before creating a VPC is an elastic IP

1. Go to elastic IP's, under network and security on your Dashboard.
2. Click on Allocate Elastic IP Address.
3. You will want to set the Network Border Group to your location. In this case we will be using us-west 2. Click allocate.

  You now have a public IPv4 Address.
  
## VPC Wizard

 1. Go to VPC. (As you can see every region has a default vpc.) 
 2. You will launch the VPC Wizard.
 3. Select the option for **VPC with Public and Private Subnet** and click select.

This option will create a NAT Gateway for you. Which will do the network address translation.

4. You can use the default iPv4 CIDR block.
 5. Name your VPC.
 6. You can leave the defaults for the public and private subnets for this exercise. 
 7. Make sure your availability zones are set to your location. 
 8. Enter the Elastic IP Allocation ID you created and create the VPC.

9. Head over to subnets.
 10.  You should see the original subnets from the default VPC and the two new ones you just created. 
 11. We will create two more subnets. Click create subnet.
 12. Select the VPC you created for VPC ID
 13. Name your subnet.
 14. Select your availability zone.
 15. For iPv4  CIDR Block insert 10.0.2.0/24 and create.
 16. Repeat the steps above with the private subnet. Set the iPv4 to 10.0.3.0/24. 
 17. Make sure your route table target is set to the igw internet gateway.

1. Launch an instance. 
2.  Select the Amazon AMI Select the free tier.   
3. On Step 3 change the Network to the VPC you created earlier.
4. Select the public subnet you created. 
5. Enable the Auto-assign IP.
6. Next add storage. 
7. Next add tags.
8. Next configure security group
9. Change the source to 130.166.0.0/16
10. Review and Launch. 
11. Launch it and choose the key you have. 
12. Repeat the steps with the private subnet. with 10.0.0.0/16.
13. Add another rule with the type htttp and same source.

Make sure your instances are running. Now in your terminal run `ssh -i your keyname nameofuser@yourIPaddress`
