# Introduction to PHP
*Note this post was made for quick referencing when writing in PHP*
## What is PHP?
PHP stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, it is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is mainly used for web development. It is also open source and can be embedded within HTML. PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter. It is different than JavaScript because PHP is executed on the server and then sent to the client. Where as JavaScript is executed on a browser. Just like many languages PHP runs on all major platforms like Windows, Linux, Mac OS, Unix, etc.  PHP files are known to contan text, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP code. 
## Set Up
In order to set up PHP on your computer you will need three things:

 1. Install a webserver
 2. Install PHP
 3. Install a database
## PHP Syntax
In order to begin php code one must put the start and end processing instructions `<?php` and `?>`.
An example output of text for PHP would be:
`<?php  
echo  "Hello World!";  
?>`
Always remember to end each statement with a **;**
