## XAMPP 
XAMPP is a free open source cross platform web server solution stack packaged developed by Apache Friends. XAMPP consists mainly of the Apache HTTP server, the MariaDB database, and interpreteres for script languages such as PHP and Perl. Inf act XAMPP stands for X-cross platofrm, A- Apache, M- MySQL, P- PHP, P- Perl. The difference between a regular server and XAMPP, is that XAMPP is a local server on your computer. But this can make transitions to actual live servers easier. It is good practice to execute on your local server first to test your website before submitting to a live web server. It also makes it a lot easier as XAMPP comes with a control panel to run, so you do not have to remember commands to run Apache, MySQL etc. which can be really helpful.
## Install XAMPP
Download and install XAMPP for your operating system from the following Apache Friends [page](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html). 

Now you want to launch the XAMPP Setup Wizard to begin the installation process. You will have to:

3. Bitnami for XAMPP will be offered to you. it installs open source applications on your XAMPP install. 
4. Finish Installation.

Now you can run your XAMPP Control Panel from your programs and start the Apache and MySQL servers.
