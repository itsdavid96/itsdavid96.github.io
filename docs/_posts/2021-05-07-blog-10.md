# Firewalls
*Brief Overview of Firewalls for Security in Computing*
As you may know a Firewall is a device that filters all traffic between a protected or "inside" network and a less trustworthy or "outside" network. Most firewalls run as dedicated devices so it becomes easier to design, inspect for bugs, and easier to optimize for performance. The main purpose will be to implement the security policies or rules that you set to determine what traffic can or cannot pass through. It can be referred to as a reference monitor which merans it is always invoked, tamperproof, and small and simple enough for rigorous analysis. 

You can view Firewalls as a computer traffic cop that will permit or block data flow between two parts of a network architecture. A firewall generate logs but there are no tools to edit or view these logs so if an attacker is trying to compromise your firewall system there will be no way to modify or delete those log entries. The following is an example of a Firewall Security Policy table.

## Types of Firewalls
There are different types of firewalls such as:
 - Packet filtering gateways or screening routers
 - Stateful inspection firewalls
 - Application-level gateways (Proxies)
 - Circuit-level gateways
 - Guards
 - Personal or host-based firewalls
 
 ## Packet Filtering Gateways
A Packet Filtering Gateway controls access on the basis of packet address and specific transport protocol type such as HTTP traffic. The Firewall configuration table above was an example in relation to a packet-filtering gateway. 

In the following image the firewall is filtering out Telnet traffic but is allowing HTTP traffic in. You must remember that Packet filters do not see inside a packet, instead they accept or reject packets on the basis of IP addresses and ports. Any details in the packet's data field is beyond the capability of a packet filter.
