*Brief Overview of Firewalls for Security in Computing*

# Firewalls
As you may know a Firewall is a device that filters all traffic between a protected or "inside" network and a less trustworthy or "outside" network. Most firewalls run as dedicated devices so it becomes easier to design, inspect for bugs, and easier to optimize for performance. The main purpose will be to implement the security policies or rules that you set to determine what traffic can or cannot pass through. It can be referred to as a reference monitor which merans it is always invoked, tamperproof, and small and simple enough for rigorous analysis. 

You can view Firewalls as a computer traffic cop that will permit or block data flow between two parts of a network architecture. A firewall generate logs but there are no tools to edit or view these logs so if an attacker is trying to compromise your firewall system there will be no way to modify or delete those log entries. The following is an example of a Firewall Security Policy table.

## Types of Firewalls
There are different types of firewalls such as:
 - Packet filtering gateways or screening routers
 - Stateful inspection firewalls
 - Application-level gateways (Proxies)
 - Circuit-level gateways
 - Guards
 - Personal or host-based firewalls
 
 ## Packet Filtering Gateways
A Packet Filtering Gateway controls access on the basis of packet address and specific transport protocol type such as HTTP traffic. The Firewall configuration table above was an example in relation to a packet-filtering gateway. 

In the following image the firewall is filtering out Telnet traffic but is allowing HTTP traffic in. You must remember that Packet filters do not see inside a packet, instead they accept or reject packets on the basis of IP addresses and ports. Any details in the packet's data field is beyond the capability of a packet filter.

## Stateful Inspection Firewall
As you may know now Packet filtering gateways maintain no state from one packet to the next as they simply just look at each packet's IP address and ports and compare them to the configured policies. On the other hand Stateful Inspection Firewalls maintain strate information from one packet to the next. 

In the following image the firewall is counting the number of systems coming from external IP 10.1.3.1. Then the external system reaches out to a fourth computer where the firewall hits a configured threshold and begins filtering packets from that address.

## Application Proxy
An Application proxy simulates the behavior of an application at OSI layer 7. This will make the real applicaiton reveive only requests to act properly. Application proxies can serve multiple purposes such as filtering potentially dangerous application layer requests, log requests/accesses, and cache results to save bandwidth. Application are most commonly used as a web proxy which companies use to monitor and filter employee Internet use.

## Circuit-Level Gateway
A circuit-level gateway is a firewall that allows one network to be an extension of another layer. This gateway operates at OSI layer 5, the session layer, and it acts as a virtual gateway between two networks. A circuit-level gateway can also connect two seperate subnetworks as if they were one unit.  The following image is of a company that has two offices with they own network addresses, 100.1.1.x and 200.1.1.x. The company wants to ensure the communication between the two addresses in private so Network admins install a pari of encryption devices  and the circuit-level gateway routes all traffic to the encryption device.

## Guard
Guard is a sohpisticated firewall that can interpret data at the protocol level and respond, similar to an application proxy. The guard will determine what services to perform on the user's behalf in accordance to the information available. The difference between Guard and application proxy is that the more features an application proxy implements, the more it becomes like a guard. 
Guards can implement any programmable set of rules such as limiting the number of email messages a user can receive and limiting user's web bandwidth.

## Personal Firewalls
A personal firewall runs on a workstation or a server and can enforce security policy. A personal firewall is a program that runs on a single host to monitor and control traffic to that host. In addition to restricting traffic by source IP and destination port, personal firewalls can also restrict which applications are allows to use the network. 

The following is a brief table summarizing key points and differences covered in this post.
